# Cocotte

Cocotte is aimed at easing the learning curve for web developers starting with cloud hosting and application containerization. You get a basic and affordable installation, allowing you to focus on your project(s) first, and learn about your infrastructure later.

Specifically, Cocotte is a free cloud installer for hosting multiple containerized applications, each accessible through https with a different hostname, but all hosted on one cloud machine at 5$ a month. This is the only cost for the infrastructure that Cocotte puts in place:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers for all processes (free).
* [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) as the cloud provider (5$ a month).
* [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) as the reverse proxy for hostname routing and SSL certificates automation (free).
* [Logz.io](https://logz.io/) (an ELK stack as a service) for monitoring all the logs generated by your applications (the free version).

This is just an installer though. You will have to learn eventually how it works. But as opposed to a solution that would lock you in, once the cloud machine is provisioned, you are in control and you don't need Cocotte anymore. 

Optionally, in the hope to get you started even faster, a template feature is available for adding a new Docker application to your infrastructure. It generates deployment scripts for a https web server, in a folder ready for source control. Two templates are available, a simple web server with a "Hello world" page, and a Symfony 4 application. The intended way of developing and deploying with these application models is documented.

Cocotte is fully tested on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/chrif/cocotte), which means that it really works on Digital Ocean when the build succeeds. No surprise with tutorials that used to work when they were written but are now outdated.
